    <p>Green sea turtles are what they eat!</p>
    <p>Green sea turtles are unique among sea turtles in that they are primarily <b>herbivores</b>, 
        eating mostly <b>seagrasses</b> and <b>algae</b>. <br>
        This diet is what gives their cartilage and fat a greenish color (not their shells), 
        which is where their name comes from.</p>
